## User experience of an OTP

Have you faced any such user experience irritant in your day to day life?
Today I made two bank payments through my browser with two different banks and realized how much user experience and design thinking is important. I have attached my phoneâ€™s SMS screenshot for SMS messages which carried the OTP.

First message shows the OTP in right as a second word in the sentence which means also shows directly on the alert message. It was as simple as looking at the alert message and filling the OTP in my browser.

The second message has OTP at the end of the sentence. So it required me to open the locked phone, then open the Message app, open the OTP message, look for the OTP within the message, memorise it and then enter it in my browser OTP field. And all the time I was worried that my transaction in the browser may time out anytime.

This shows how a simple word placement can lead to a bad user experience. Any good user experience designer with an eye for details should avoid such mistakes.
