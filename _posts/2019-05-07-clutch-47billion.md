47Billion is thrilled to announce that we have been named one of the top creative and design agencies by [Clutch](https://clutch.co)!

“Without creativity and design agencies, the innovative tools being developed  would be useless.” Says [Jeremy Fishman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-fishman-1ba6b475/), a Clutch Business Analyst. “These companies listed here make the technology tools we benefit from more user-friendly and look better. They should be extremely proud of their work and their inclusion in this announcement.”

Clutch is a B2B ratings and reviews site based in Washington DC. They provide market insights and rankings of businesses by service focus and location. Their rankings are based on a number of factors including thought leadership, accolades, and [Client reviews](https://clutch.co/profile/47billion).

In addition to our recognition as a top creative agency, we also hold a top 10 spot on Clutch’s list of the best [Big Data Companies](https://clutch.co/in/it-services/analytics/leaders-matrix).
